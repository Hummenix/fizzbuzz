# fizzbuzz

FizzBuzz is a programming "challenge" where you have to complete the objective below in any (given) programming language.

This repository will be a collection of FizzBuzz in different languages I happen to come across.

#### Objective:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz".


#### License:
Yes, there is a license. I used the MIT license just for the unlikely case that someone uses this for Idk tutorials or something... Applicable unless stated otherwise.
